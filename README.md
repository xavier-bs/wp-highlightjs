## Work in progess ##

The project is in the *development* phase.

## Description ##

Add a new block to use _highlight.js_ as code syntax highlighter.

I wanted to do that, and I learned about React and React Ace. As gluttony arrives while tasting, I pushed the development by discovering React and Gutenberg always more in depth, options in InspectorControls, preview for the code and managing a button in the BlockControls Toolbar.

I discover that _highlighjs_ does not colored the languages functions and I was a bit frustrated, but that it is still very fast.
